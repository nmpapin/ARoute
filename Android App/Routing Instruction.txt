Routing Idea:

Create MartaRouting object

MartaRouting.getRoute
	returns ArrayList of all the Transit stops and directions	
	 contains all the transit markers, directions, time, etc...

	begins with first marta stop, ends with last marta stop

Drawing Route - Separate into 3 different methods for better maintainability

1. Use RoutePoint.getOverlay to draw all the overlay icons on map

2. Connect RoutePoints with RouteOverlay (draws line)
	generate waypoints using
		Using Routing class with "walking" if walking stop
		Using Routing Class with "driving" if bus stop
	No way points if Rail (straight line)

3. Add walking overlay to/from start and end stops using existing code
	I will modify this function if time to include actual walking turn directions
